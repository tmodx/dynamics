This repository has a lot of the project files I used to make the Newton's Laws of Motion video

# Animations
I made the animations by a combination of Manim, Blender, and DaVinci Resolve (a code library, 3d modeling software, and video editing software respectively). Most of the Manim code I used for the video is in the `manim/` folder, sorted by chapter and timestamp. Here is a good guide for setting up Manim on Windows if you want to use it.

# Script
The main script I used for the video is in `script.md`.
